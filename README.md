# 🧠 CTF Write-Ups Archive

Welcome to my personal archive of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge write-ups. This repository contains documentation for every challenge I've tackled since I began recording my progress and problem-solving approaches.

## 📚 Purpose

I started writing these to:

- Stay organized and track my learning journey
- Reflect on both successes and mistakes
- Build a personal archive I can revisit anytime
- Make it easier to resume challenges after a long break
- Share insights and strategies with others

Whether a challenge is solved or still in progress, having a clear record of my thought process has been invaluable for growth. These write-ups are more than just solutions—they're a window into how I think, debug, and learn.

## 🤝 For Newcomers

I hope you find these write-ups helpful. I uploaded them with the intention of supporting newcomers and not just by providing answers, but by sharing the journey behind each solution. My goal is to help others learn from both my successes and missteps, and maybe even spark new ideas or approaches.

of course when reading the write-ups the flags will not be supplied. they will be hidden using `[flag🤫]`
